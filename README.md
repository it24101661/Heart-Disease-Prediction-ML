Machine learning project for heart disease prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This academic project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using patient medical data. The goal was to apply data preprocessing techniques and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (heart.csv)
- Contains patient health attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Encoding:
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
  - Label Encoding for binary features
- Feature scaling where required

## 🤖 Model Selection & Evaluation
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

After evaluation, **Random Forest** produced the best performance and was selected as the final model.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with data preprocessing
- Understanding encoding techniques
- Model comparison and selection
- Applying ML to healthcare data
